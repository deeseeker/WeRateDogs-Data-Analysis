Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. Do you want to know what the most prevalent dog stage on this account is or do you have a wonderful dog but don't know what name to give him? In this analysis, you will get an answer to that and more\n"
